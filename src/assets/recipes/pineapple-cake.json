Using 1¼-inch round cutter or apple corer, remove core from pineapple slices to create rings; discard core pieces." },

Bring to boil over medium-high heat and cook until rings have softened, about 10 minutes, flipping rings halfway through cooking. Transfer rings to prepared pan, placing 1 ring in center of pan and arranging remaining 6 rings around circumference of pan (rings will fit snugly in pan without overlapping). Place cherries in centers of rings." },

Carefully stir in 12 tablespoons butter and ½ teaspoon salt until butter is melted (caramel may look separated at first). Return mixture to boil and cook until frothy and uniform in texture, about 1 minute. Let caramel cool off heat for 5 minutes." },

        { "text": "Transfer pan to wire rack. Immediately run paring knife between cake and sides of pan. Using toothpick, poke about 80 holes evenly over cake. Microwave reserved caramel mixture until warm, about 1 minute. Brush cake with ½ cup reserved caramel mixture. Let cake cool in pan for 25 minutes. Carefully invert cake onto serving plate. Brush top of cake with remaining reserved caramel mixture as desired. Serve warm or at room temperature, passing any remaining caramel mixture separately." }
