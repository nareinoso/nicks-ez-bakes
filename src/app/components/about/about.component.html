        Hi! I’m Nick Reinoso, the baker behind The Caffeinated Baker.
        Born and raised in Texas, I grew up surrounded by delicious food and family traditions.
        My love for cooking started early,
        watching FoodTV as a kid and experimenting with dessert recipes.
        My mom, Priscilla, was my first cooking teacher,
        sharing her family recipes and teaching me the basics.
        With her guidance and plenty of practice,
        I became hooked on creating sweet treats—probably because of my serious sweet tooth!

        Throughout high school and college, I continued to explore the world of baking and cooking,
        eventually turning it into a side gig.
        From selling cakes to friends and family to making a wedding cake for my best friend,
        baking has become more than just a hobby for me. My fondness for kitchen gadgets and techniques
        has only grown over the years, and I’m always looking for new ways to improve my skills.
